                <p class="story">Somehow I didnâ€™t have any opportunities to take an airplane when I was a child, so I had no idea how I would feel about being at the airport. I started traveling abroad by myself after graduating from college. Every time I went abroad, I got to know someone sitting next to me on the plane. Since then, the airport became a fun place for me. There are a lot of real dramas at the airport; going on a vacation; saying good-bye to family and friends, and welcoming people home. Indeed, the airport is the place where I see my family first after a long flight, and as soon as I see them, I already feel <span class="bold">HOME</span> before actually going back to my house.
